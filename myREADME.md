## Objective

The aim of this Project was to understand the use of Dom, using helper functions and initialising them into our oun codes. This objects aim to help us to be aware that when codind we need to be aware of the errors in our codes. It helps us to understand the real world application of using the things dynamic like changes tasks from 1 place to another.

## Challenges

When i was busy with this Project it was so difficult at first until i solved all the errors in the code. Understanding someones code is very hard and i believe that its a very difficult skill to gain, since i struggled so much to see what most of the code wanted and needed. i struggled also not seeing if the click() was wrong since i was so stressed so much. For me is more of not understanding the logic of the code.I also had a struggle trying to display my tasks on the userInterface

## Sollutions

Everything started to clarify after I invested more than 16 hours unraveling the logic behind the code. In this process, I discovered numerous errors, including syntax issues and incorrect assignments, all of which I was able to rectify. I also became adept at using localStorage, a tool that lets web applications store data persistently in a web browser. I made user interface improvements too, such as changing the dark image to light when the toggle switch is flipped. Additionally, I fixed the issue of accurately displaying tasks on the user interface by ensuring the correct elements were called and linked properly, which had previously been a challenge.


## improvements

I want to do more of this task over and over again. until i can grasp how they used those helper function because they made our work much easier. i also want to go back and study everything i learned in this Project piece by piece from objects to using the Dom.
